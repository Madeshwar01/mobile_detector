The basic principle behind the Cell Phone Detector circuits is to detect the RF Signals. In the Schottky diode circuit, the Schottky Diode is used to detect the cell phone signal as they have a unique property of being able to rectify low frequency signals, with low noise rate. When an inductor is placed near the RF signal source, it receives the signal through mutual induction. This signal is rectified by the Schottky diode. This low power signal can be amplified and used to power any indicator like an buzzer in this case
